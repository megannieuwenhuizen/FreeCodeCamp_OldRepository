    <h3>Collection of Work</h3>
    <p>One of the greatest Post-Impressionists of all time; Vincent produced a mass amount of work in his lifetime. Striking in colour, his emphatic brushwork continues to inspire modern Expressionism. </p>

    <h3>Childhood and Upbringing</h3>
    <h4>1853-1873</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Vincent was born 30 March 1853 in the Brubant village located in Zundert, Southern Netherlands. His mother Anna Carbentus and father Theodorus Van Gogh (a Protestant Minister) first son had been a stillborn born a year before to the day of Vincents birth. Succeeding him where his three sisters Anna, Lies and Cor, followed by his two brothers Theo and Wil.</li> 
    <li>The Van Gogh family frequently walked around the Zundert area to which would eventually in still an appreciation of nature for the artist  </li>
    <li>Vincent never enjoyed school but managed to complete hise elementary schooling. Although in Secondary school he earned good marks for languages, he quit secondary school in 1967.</li> 
    <li>At 16 he accepted an apprenticeship at The Hague, a branch of the art dealers Goupil and Co. where his uncle was a partner.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="youngadult">
    <h3>Journey to Passion</h3>
    <h4>1871-1880</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Being the youngest clerk at the art dealer, he assisted his uncle at the branch. His world renowned letters to his brother Theo began at this time, who was working for another branch of the Goupel dealers in Brussels, London. </li>
    <li>Later that year he joined his brother in London; he had begun to develop his artistic sensibility and had enjoyed for many of the Dutch Masters such as Rembrandt, and Frans Hals. However, his preference leaned more towards French painters such as Jean-François Millet and Camille Corot whose influence would continue to influence his own artistic style. </li>
    <li>Whist in London he began visiting famous institutions such as the British Museum and the National Galary.</li>
    <li>Vincent, an already solitary creature began disliking art dealing and his approach to life further darkened when his love was rejected by a London girl in 1874. Soon after he began working as a language teacher and became increasingly religious. </li>
    <li>Van Gogh felt compelled to server humanity and envisioned entering a ministry. This dream too was thwarted as in 1878 whilst doing evangelist short-term training as he disagreed with the orthodox doctrinal approach. </li>
    <li>His missionary work in Borinage earned him the nickname 'The Christ of the Coal Mine' as he attempted to build a congregation living among the miners and their families. </li>
    <li> In Vincents correspondence with his beloved brother Theo whilst in Borinage, Theo advised Vincent to invest more into his drawings. </li> 
    <li>He became convinced that he could serve God as an artist, and began working on his drawing technique and started surrounding himself with other artists instead of missionary work in October 1880. As Van Gogh no longer had a stable income, Theo would send him money from time to time.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>First Steps as an Artist</h3>
    <h4>1881-1883</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Vincent's dream of an artist's life was not met with his parents approval. He began working hard to improve his style and his skills. </li>
    <li>Initially, Vincent moved back in with his parents who had taken on the perspective that being an artist was a social failure. He practiced drawing frequently inside and outdoors.
    </li>
    <li>After trying to court his widowed cousin with persistence, his family disapproved immensely. Afamily feud that had been escalating, coming to fruition on Christmas Day 1881, resulting in him walking out of the family home. </li>
    <li>Vincent moved into The Hague and bean receiving painting (watercolour and oil) lessons from Anton Mauve, his cousin by marriage. He still felt that his style was not honed, and began drawing frantically at every opportunity.</li>
    <li>His uncle gave him his first commission:Twelve drawings of the city views in Hague. This commision allowed him to work on his perspective skills, whilst also articipating in Anton Mauve's art lessons daily.</li>
    <li>Vincents painful affair began in 1882 when he met Sien Hoornik . She became his muse, model and his lover. This affair was not seen without jusdgement as Sien was a former prostitute. This was further compilcated by the fact that she had a five-year-old daughter and was pregnant. Vincent felt compassion for Sien and was determined to take care of her. They rented a studio in which she, the little girl and the new baby could all live as well. Theo did not approve of Vincent’s choice, but continued to support him financially. Vincent remained stubborn, but eventually realized that their relationship was not working, resulting in him breaking it off.</li>
    <li>Following his breakup with Sien, Vincent travelled to the countryside in Drenthe to draw and paint the heathland and moors. He thought that the landscape was beautiful and set to work in good spirits. However, the province did not only bring him peace and inspiration, but also the realization on the dependence of money, and trying to endure the loneliness in isolation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Developing Peasant Artist</h3>
    <h4>1883-1886</h4>
    <ul>  
    <li>Initially, Vincent moved in with his parents in Nuenen and worked in a small studio at the back of the house. The town itself was an ideal  space for him to begin establishing a studio space and a few months later he began renting a larger studio in the area.</li>
    <li>Many of the towns people were labourers, farm workers and weavers, who soon became subjects of his artwork.</li>
    <li>In return for his allowance from his brother Theo, Vincent began sending some of his work to his brother for the compensation of the allowance he had been receiving.</li>
    <li>Shortly after his father died in 1885, he moved into his studio permanently as his family still struggled with his unconvential lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Vincent began working on his infamous series "The Potato Eaters", he spent most of his money on art supplies and low budget meals.</li>
    <li>In late 1885, he decided to enrol in an artcourse in the Netherlands at Antwerp academy of art.</li>
    <li>As much as Antwerp had a lot to offer him in terms of good materials, drawing classes and many sources of inspiration, he found that the art classes had too much of a traditional approach to his unique style.</li>
    <li> On leaving Antwerp, he moved back to Paris and take lessons in the studio of Fernand Cormon. He arrived in Paris earlier than planned (end of February 1886), before Theo could find an apartment big enough for the both of them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>From Grayscale to Colour</h3>
    <h4>1886-1888</h4>
    <ul>  
    <li>Theo had become the manager of the Goupil art dealers Paris branch. He began introducing his brother to the colourful works of prominent modern arists of the time like Claude Monet. </li>
    <li>He was introduced to various new artists through meeting at Fernand Cormon's studio. These artists like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Emile Bernard; whose impressions, perspective changes and influence directly affected his approach to his stle. He began working on experimenting more freely with his colours and style. </li>
    <li>His light, colour, and outlines began to grow steadily with influence of modern art, even developing his own own styke of painting with short brush strokes.</li>
    <li>His sources of study began to shift from rural labourers of cafe's and boulevards, countysides along the Siene and flora stil lifes. This grew to include portraits, unable to afford a moel, he used self portraits to improve his skill.</li>
    <li>Another unlikely source of inspiration was a growing fasination with Japanese woodcuts. He was fascinaated with the influence of bold oulines, cropping and colour contrasts in these prints. Vincent and Theo egan collecting them, the contrasts of the woodcut style immediately refected in his work.</li>
    <li>Whilst in Paris, his artistic style had shifted drastically into brighter colours and bolder outines - his unique vibrance in colour coming to fruition. However, the bustling citylife that had initially yielded him so much inspiration, now became overwhelming. He wished for the escape of the countryside and tried to find more landscapes that had hints og the light and colour of 'Japanese' landscapes. Hoping to find this, he moved to Arles, a small town set on the River Rhône in Provence, the South of France. The train he took departed on 20 February 1888 and lasted a full day and night to reach Provence.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="france">
    <h3>South of France</h3>
    <h4>1888-1890</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Inspired by the bright light and endless natural colours in the town of Arles, Vincent enthusiastically started working on painting the orchards in bloom, and many of the workers gathering harvest. He went on a trip to the coast side and painted the boats.</li>
    <li>Vincent's style became looser and more expressive, writing to Theo he revealed that he planned to set up a 'Studio of the South' for a group of artists. He admitted that he felt that artists always lose when they are isolated and hoped that his brother could sell the groups art in Paris.</li>
    <li>The first and only artist to move in with Van Gogh was Paul Gauguin arriving late October 1888. The "Yellow House" with four rooms in Place Lamartine. Theo had to cajole Gauguin into moving in, but sais in a letter to his brother that he hoped Gauguin's presence would assist in his effort to create a home for artists, although it would be a big change for him.</li>
    <li>Van Gogh and Gauguin's collaboration resulted in exceptional paintings, but their conflicting views on art caused many heated discussions.</li>
    <li>Both artists had different processes of painting, Gauguin working from his memory and imagination; Van Gogh preferred working with subjects and being inspired by his surroundings. Similair to their art styles, their clashing characters caused tension to rise steadily.</li>
    <li>Vincent began dispalying signs of agitation due to the tension, and when Gauguin threatened to leave the house, it triggered him. He threatened his friend with a razor and later that night sliced off his own ear in the house. He wrapped his ear in newspaper and tried to present it to a prostitute in the red-light district.</li>
    <li>The morning after he had inflicted the damage, Van Gogh was admitted to the hostpital in Arles. Writing to his family, Theo fearfully admitted that seeing his brother in the hospital made him realise that his brother was experiencing signs of 'madness'. He further expressed his worry that the doctors hoped he wouldn't remain 'insane', but he was not so sure.</li>
    <li>After visting the hospital, Theo returned to Paris with Gauguin. Vincents hope to create a shared artist space had proven to be short-lived.</li>
    <li>Vincent did not reember much about the ear incident. He was discharged in January 1889 and resumed painting. He continued to struggle with his mental health, which fluctuated greatly. By May he feared another mental break, he admitted himself volountarily to Saint-Paul-de-Mausole psychiatric hospital in Saint-Remy.</li>
    <li>Despite his struggles with hus mental illness, he continued to work. Creating some of his most famous paintings and drawings in this time. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
     <div id="hospital">
    <h3>Hospitalization</h3>
    <h4>1889-1889</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Despite his unstable mental health in the year that Vincent spent in the mental hospital, in terms of his art Vincent created about 150 paintings in that year, including Almond Blossom. </li>
    <li>His initial arrival at Saint-Rémy was spent on recovery, but he had made sufficient progress in his recovery he began working on his painting again.</li>
    <li>On his good days he would paint in the walled garden of the institution, and was later allowed outside the hospital to paint. He was eventually given an additional room in the cinic to be used as a studio. He would work on creating copies of prints after paintings by artists like Rembrandt and Millet.</li>
    <li>His mental health continued to fluctuate and he experienced bouts of confusion. In one of these bouts he ate some of his oil paint and he was restricted from working on his art for a time. Despite these confusions he produced more than 150 paintings.</li>
    <li>During Theo's time overseas, he married Johanna Bonger in April 1889 in Amsterdam. A year later Vincent received a birth announcement in the mail whilst still at Saint-Rémy. Theo and Jo named their son after him: Vincent William Van Gogh. He had been working on a painting for them, the famous Almond Blossom. </li>
    <li>
    He wrote to his mother that he would have rather they had named the child after his father that had passed. However, since the child had been named he had started making a painting for Theo and Jo to hang in their room. He described it as "Large branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky."
    </li>
    <li>Six of Vincents paintings where exhibited at a group exhibition of the Belgians association in Brussels. The show was cakked 'Less Vingt' (The Twenty).</li>
    <li>Albert Aurier an art critic at the had published a few positive articles abou Vincents work and one of the exhibited paintings, The Red Vineyard. This painting was sold during the show even though it had been exhibited more than once. His work had started being appreciated.</li>
    <li>Ten of Vincents works had been selected for inclusion in March at an Independents exhibition. Theo wrote to him saying he would have been so pleased if Vincent had been there, that the paintings were well placed and looked well. They also received many compliments, the highest being that Gauguin said that the paintings were the key to the exhibition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vincent's Final Months</h3>
    <h4>1890</h4>
       <ul>
         <li>Vincent left the hospital in Saint-Rémy in May 1890, he moved to Auvers-sur-Oise were he knew several artists were currently resiging. The place offered Vincent peace and quiet in nature that che needed, whilst still being close enough to Paris to visit his brother Theo. Paul Gachet, a doctor in the town kept an eye on Vincent. They became friends, as Paul was an amateur painter. He advised Van Gogh to dedicate himself completely to his art, and he did exactly that. He enthusiastically painted the gardens and wheatfields. In this period of time, he created a painting almost every day and his health seemed to be improving.</li>
         <li>When visiting his borther Theo in 1890, he found out that Theo was considering resigning from his job at the art dealers and wanted to opening his own business. When he returned to Auvers, he was extremely concerned about the financial burden he posed on his brother. Even though his brother Theo and his wife Jo reassured him that this wasnt the case, the financial burden and worry that his nervous attacks would return started impacting his health. He could not shake the gloom he felt about his impending future.</li>
         <li>Even though he found the country side "healthy and fortifying", his illness and uncertainty about his future became overwhelming.<li>
         <li>On 27 July 1890, Vincent walked into a wheatfield and shot himself in the chest with a pistol. The wounded artist staggered back to his room at the Auberge Ravoux. Theo rushed from Paris to Auvers and was present when his brother died of his injuries on 29 July.</li>

    <li>Vincent was buried at Auvers on 30 July 1890. His legacy was a large body of art works: over 850 paintings and almost 1,300 works on paper.</li>

    <h3>After Vincents Death</h3>
    <h4>1890</h4>
       <ul>
         <li>Six weeks after Vincent’s death, Theo organized a memorial exhibition of his brother’s work. His many exertions and setbacks in his own life meant that his own health was now steadily deteriorating too. </li>
         <li>Shortly after the exhibition, Theo resigned from Boussod with immediate effect, and promptly suffered a severe nervous breakdown.</li>
    <li>Theo was admitted to a clinic in Utrecht, suffering from syphilis-related physical and mental symptoms. He died there at the end of January 1891, barely half a year after his brother’s death.</li>
         <li>Vincent’s paintings now came under the care of Theo’s widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger.</li>
         <li>Following Theo’s death, his widow Jo moved to the Dutch town of Bussum with her son Vincent Willem, taking Vincent and Theo’s art collection with her. </li>
         <li>She remarried in 1901 to the painter Johan Cohen Gosschalk, and the family moved to Amsterdam two years later. Jo sought to raise public awareness of Vincent’s paintings in various ways, including exhibition loans to museums all over the world. More and more buyers emerged for Van Gogh’s work.</li>
         <li>In 1914, Jo published the first edition of Vincent’s letters to Theo, and that same year she had Theo reinterred in Auvers-sur-Oise, in a grave alongside his brother’s.</li>

    <h3>The Van Gogh Musuem</h3>
    <h4>1925 - Present</h4>
       <ul>
         <li>Following Jo’s death in 1925 Vincent and Theo’s art collection passed to her son, the engineer Vincent Willem van Gogh, who loaned his uncle’s paintings to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1930.</li>
    <li>As Vincent’s fame grew, however, there were calls for the collection to be placed in a dedicated museum.
    <li>In 1962, with the consent of the State of the Netherlands, ‘the Engineer’ transferred the Van Gogh collection to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation. In return, the State undertook to build the Van Gogh Museum and subsequently to ensure that the collection is accessible to everyone forever.</li>
    <li>Eleven years later the works were moved from the Stedelijk Museum to a specially designed building by Gerrit Rietveld.</li>
    <li>Queen Juliana opened the Van Gogh Museum on 2 June 1973, since when it has drawn visitors from every corner of the world. Two million people now visit the museum every year.</li>
        </ul>

       <div id="conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>Vincent has become one of the greatest artists known to the world, he truly inspires not only with his colours, his paint style, but his way of animating life into fantasy. Would a tortured mind such as his have had the same issues entering the art world as he did then? In a world of social media and online presence, many artists are lost in the algorithm. The true message behind his paintings will always elude us, all we can do is learn from him and encourage artists around us in order to ensure that history does not repeat.</p>
